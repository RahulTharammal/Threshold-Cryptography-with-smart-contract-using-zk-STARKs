# Threshold Cryptography with Smart Contract using zk-STARKs

This repository contains an implementation of Threshold Cryptography with smart contracts using zk-STARKs. Threshold Cryptography is a cryptographic technique where a secret is divided into multiple shares distributed among participants, requiring a threshold number of shares to reconstruct the secret. zk-STARKs (Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent Arguments of Knowledge) are succinct, transparent, and post-quantum secure zero-knowledge proofs. 

## Introduction

Threshold Cryptography ensures that critical operations can only be performed when a threshold number of participants agree, enhancing security and mitigating single points of failure. By integrating zk-STARKs into smart contracts, we achieve transparency and scalability while ensuring privacy and security.

## Features

- **Threshold Cryptography**: Utilizes Threshold Cryptography to distribute and manage secrets among multiple participants.
- **zk-STARKs**: Implements zk-STARKs for transparent and scalable zero-knowledge proofs within smart contracts.
- **Security**: Ensures secure and private operations through cryptographic techniques.
- **Transparency**: Leverages zk-STARKs to provide transparency in smart contract operations.
- **Scalability**: Provides scalability in handling cryptographic operations within smart contracts.
